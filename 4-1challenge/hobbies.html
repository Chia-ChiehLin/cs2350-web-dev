            My first and foremost favorite hobby is tennis. I love to grab my racket, head to the tennis court, 
            and engage in thrilling matches. The feeling of hitting the ball with precision and agility is incredibly 
            satisfying. It's a sport that challenges both my physical abilities and mental focus. Whether it's a 
            friendly game or a competitive tournament, tennis never fails to bring excitement and joy. The picture 
            above captures a moment of me playing a tennis match at the Ogden Athletic Club, showcasing the passion 
            and dedication I have for this sport.

            My second favorite hobby is beach exploration. The coastal areas are a wonderful place to enjoy the beach. 
            The views and sights are just breathtaking. Relaxing under the sun and swimming in the crystal-clear waters 
            are some of the highlights. The picture above is me enjoying a beach day near Shimen Cave in Taiwan.

            My third favorite hobby is hiking. Taroko National Park in Taiwan offers breathtaking beauty, with the majestic 
            Taroko Gorge as its centerpiece. Exploring its trails reveals soaring cliffs, cascading waterfalls, and diverse 
            wildlife. It's a place of wonder and serenity, where nature's grandeur leaves an indelible mark on the soul.

            My fourth hobby is singing. I love expressing myself through music and belting out my favorite tunes. Whether 
            it's singing along to the radio or performing on stage, it brings me joy and allows me to connect with others 
            through the power of music. Singing is my passion.

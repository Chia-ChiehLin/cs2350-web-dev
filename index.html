    <h1>Assignments Page</h1>
    <h3><p>This page contains definitions for various activities in CS 2350 Client-Side Web Development,
      including Learning Activities, TryOut Activities, and Challenge Activities.</p></h3>
    <h2>Learning Activities</h2>
    <h3><p>The purpose of these activities is to facilitate learning of the topics covered in each module.
      Students are encouraged to engage in various tasks such as watching videos, reading materials,
      and actively participating in the class discussion forum. It is important for students to ask
      questions and share additional resources from external sources that have aided their understanding
      of the material.</p></h3>
    <h2>Try it Out Activities</h2>
    <h3><p>The purpose of these activities is to provide students with an opportunity to apply and reinforce
      the skills they are acquiring. They are designed to include clear instructions and supportive materials
      to aid in completing the tasks. By engaging in these activities, students can enhance their learning
      experience and improve their overall score. While these activities carry a relatively low weightage
      in the final grading, their emphasis lies on completion. It is recommended to finish them at least
      two days prior to attempting the Challenge Activities, allowing the instructor ample time to provide
      feedback and address any queries.</p></h3>
    <h2>Challenge Activities</h2>
    <h3><p>The challenge activities serve as a means for students to showcase their mastery of the learning objectives.
      These activities are specifically designed to incorporate the skills outlined in the learning objectives.
      The bulk of module points are allocated to the challenge activities as they carry significant weight in
      assessing the student's performance.</p></h3>

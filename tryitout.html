           Littleton, Colorado, are seeking to enhance their website's content regarding their renowned tour called
           "Bike the Mountains Tour." This six-day adventure takes cyclists through some of Colorado's highest roads
           and is highly sought after by enthusiasts. Adriana has already enlisted a colleague to create a three-column 
           layout featuring a list of links in the first column and descriptive text in the second and third columns. 
           Now, she is seeking your expertise to finalize the design by formatting the text and selecting appropriate

           a new page describing the DLR morning schedule needs to be created, incorporating these modifications. The content and style

        <p class="custom-font">In this assignment, I learned how to complete a web development project that includes a Hitori puzzle game. I needed to use 
          JavaScript to implement game functionalities and ensure proper connections with style sheets and graphic files. Additionally, I learned how to 
          handle the onload event and use the startUp function. I associated event handlers with puzzle buttons, switched between multiple puzzles, and 
          added my own "countdown" and "reset" functionalities to the project, resulting in a more complete presentation of the assignment.</p>

        <img src="images/Bridger_Federalist.png" alt="My Image" width="400" height="250">
        <p class="custom-font"> I utilized event listeners to trigger the findKeyWords and makeKeyStyles functions when the page loads. The findKeyWords 
          function effectively generated the keyword list by querying and sorting the relevant elements. Additionally, I successfully linked each item in 
          the list to the corresponding keywords in the document using IDs and href attributes.
